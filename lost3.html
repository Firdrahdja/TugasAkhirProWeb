            <h2>Cut Content</h2><br>
			<img src="Images\NFSMW12\cut.jpg" alt="Icon" style="width:500px;" class="center"><br>
            <p>Most Wanted 2 was conceived as a working title around 2011. The game would have been a direct sequel to the original Most Wanted of 2005 and would have included many elements from previous games in the series, such as car customization options and a storyline. These concepts, however, were ultimately scrapped, and the final release was radically different, with little influence from the 2005 game other than its title. A lot of the cut content can be found in the game's files.[1]
			In late 2016, a thread on Need for Speed Theories discussing unused content from the game was created, which, among other things, presented leaked concept art from a developer portfolio.[2] In 2017, Youtube channel Obscure Gamers shared gameplay footage of a prototype build of the game. However, it was taken down sometime later.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2><br>
			<img src="Images\NFSMW12\gameplay3.jpg" alt="Icon" style="width:500px;" class="center"><br>
            <p>The gameplay footage shows an initial cutscene narrated by what may be the main protagonist. 
			The player can freely drive through a vast open world. As in other Need for Speed games, escaping from the police is a prominent part of the gameplay. The player can use weapons such as "spike strips" against police cars in pursuit, another feature that was removed from the final release.</p>
